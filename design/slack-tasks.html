            </p>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Slack lets teams of any size communicate in ways that email never allowed for, boosting their productivity and helping
                them reach their goals faster. However, Slack doesn’t afford its users any way of visualising these goals or
                designating tasks to specific users and sub-teams. Existing task organisers such as Todoist and Trello have Slack Apps,
                but these are limited in functionality and still require the user to switch to the native apps to be productive. For
                example, the Todoist Slack App only allows users to create tasks. Additionally, both of these apps rely almost
                exclusively on text input which, while efficient for task creation, is not ideal for editing existing tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to design this feature for Slack as, in my role as a director of MHacks, I need to allocate tasks to over 30
                people at a time across a variety of sub-teams. Our Logistics-UX team, for example, has 14 sub-teams each with their
                own set of tasks. As a result, we’ve had issues with clearly communicating responsibilities and tracking our progress
                towards our goals. We’ve used everything from Google Docs to Slack Posts to assign tasks to our members, but these have
                had limited success for a few reasons. First, neither is easily accessible from Slack at any time—even pinned Slack
                Posts get lost in the sea of information our Slack team encounters on the daily. Second, neither offers a convenient
                way to assign tasks to users. Third, they both lack any sort of notification or reminder system to help users stay on
                track, so it’s up to the user to continuously check on their deliverables.

            </p>

            <h2>My Solution</h2>
            <p>
                My solution sits in the same space as channel information and user profiles—in a pane on the right of the Slack app.
                It’s a chronologically-ordered todo list specific to the current channel being displayed. This allows teams within an
                organisation to separate their responsibilities. Tasks can be added from this pane or from the Slack message field and
                can be assigned to individual users or user groups. Tasks can also be given due dates and times, which will appear to
                the right of each task and be colour-coded according to their proximity to the current date. Task creation will use
                natural language processing to parse the input and find due dates and times, and Slackbot will use this information to
                remind users of upcoming and overdue tasks.

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                I intentionally kept the task features minimal because I wanted to keep the barrier to entry of usability low, and
                because the limited real estate afforded by using Slack's right-pane means that an abundance of features could easily
                result in a cluttered interface. That being said, I’d love the opportunity to user-test this implementation and do
                research to gain an understanding of what features users desire the most. These features could include priority levels
                for tasks and sorting based on priority, for example.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the current implementation is based on the way my various Slack teams set-up channels—by creating a new
                channel for each sub-team. As such, the task list is specific to each channel and clicking on a different channel will
                change the task list being displayed. Were a Slack team to set-up channels in a different way, this implementation
                wouldn't be ideal for them. This would be another user behaviour I'd like to test for or gather data on.
